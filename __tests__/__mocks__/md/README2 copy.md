# The Art of Command Line

\_Note: I'm looking for a new (and potentially paid) lead author to help expand this to a more comprehensive Guide. While it's very popoular, it could be both deeper and more helpful. If you like to write and are close to being an expert on this material and willing to consider helping, please drop me a note at josh (0x40) holloway.com.

Fluency on the command line is a skill often neglected or considered arcane, but it improves your flexibility and productivity as an engineer in both obvious and subtle ways. This is a selection of notes and tips on using the command-line that we've found useful when working on Linux. Some tips are elementary, and some are fairly specific, sophisticated, or obscure. This page is not long, but if you can use and recall all the items here, you know a lot.
